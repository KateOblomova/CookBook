    <h3 id="costa">Ukrainian Cuisine</h3>
    <p id="chef-text">Ukrainian cuisine is the collection of the various cooking traditions of the people of Ukraine, one of the largest and most populous European countries. It is heavily influenced by the rich dark soil (chernozem) from which its ingredients come, and often involves many components. Traditional Ukrainian dishes often experience a complex heating process – "at first they are fried or boiled, and then stewed or baked. This is the most distinctive feature of Ukrainian cuisine".</p>

        <li>Onion – A yellow onion works well, but you can also use red onions if preferred. </li>
        <li>Butter – To fry the onions. If you don’t want to use butter, you can also use oil – but the butter gives them a nice flavor.

    <h3 class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12" id="direction-header">Directions</h3>
    <p class="col-12" id="directions">
      Pour warm water (not boiling water, it should be about 100 degrees Fahrenheit) into a deep mixing bowl. Add flour and salt.
      2 cups all-purpose flour,1 cup warm water,1/2 teaspoon salt
      Knead the dough first with a spoon and then with your hands until you get a soft elastic dough that is a little sticky when touching it. Alternatively, you can also use a stand mixer. Cover the ball of dough with cling film and let it rest for 30 minutes.
      While the dough is resting, cut the peeled potatoes into small cubes and put them in a saucepan. Add water and a pinch of salt and boil the potatoes until soft. Then drain all the water.
      5 large potatoes
      In a frying pan, fry the chopped onion in butter until golden brown, stirring occasionally. This should take around 5-6 minutes. If you don't like onions, feel free to omit them.
      1 yellow onion,2 tablespoons butter
      Mash the boiled potatoes with a potato masher or a fork. Then add the fried onions, salt and pepper. If you see that the potatoes are too dry, add a little bit of milk or warm water until they have a soft, slightly creamy consistency.
      1/3 teaspoon salt,1/2 teaspoon black pepper
      Once the dough has rested, it will be even softer. It will be easier to work with and it should not stick to your hands. However, it may stick a little to the table so sprinkle it with a little bit of flour. Then cut off half of the dough and roll it out until it’s very thin, approximately 1-2 mm. Next, using a glass or cup, cut out circles about 3 inches in diameter.
      On the edge of each of the circles, put a teaspoon of potato and onion filling (don't add too much filling!).
      Cover the filling by folding the dough over and pinch the edges closed. You can pinch the edges using your thumb and index finger or with a fork.
      Gather the leftover dough not cut into circles and add it to the other half of the dough. Roll it out and repeat the steps until you have used up all the dough and filling. Now the varenyky are ready for boiling.
      Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan or pot. Lightly salt it (2 pinches of salt to 3 cups of water), then add the dumplings to the water and wait until they float to the top. After they float, boil for 2 more minutes. If your pot is not very large, you might have to cook the varenyky in batches.
      Transfer the hot dumplings to a bowl and add a little bit of butter (optional). When it melts on the surface of the hot dumplings, gently stir them so as not to tear the dough, and that each dumpling is greased with butter. This way they won't stick together.
      Transfer the dumplings to a plate, sprinkle with chopped herbs if desired, and serve. The traditional version is served with sour cream, but there may be other options, such as ketchup or some other sauce. Enjoy!
